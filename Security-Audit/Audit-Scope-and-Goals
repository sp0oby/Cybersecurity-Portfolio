# Audit Scope and Goals  
**Project 1 – Security Audit & Vulnerability Identification for Small Business**  
**SecureTech Solutions Simulated Lab**

**Prepared by:** spoobs
**Date:** January 15, 2026

## Summary

This document defines the scope, objectives, and goals of the internal security audit conducted on the SecureTech Solutions backend server as part of my cybersecurity portfolio. The audit aims to align the simulated environment with industry best practices, identify vulnerabilities, and provide mitigation recommendations to improve security posture.

## Scope

The audit assessed the following in-scope elements within the isolated home lab:
- User permissions and access controls on the backend server
- Existing controls, procedures, and system protocols (network services, web application)
- Technology currently in use (Apache web server, MariaDB database, DVWA legacy portal)

**In-Scope Assets**:
- SecureTech-Server VM (192.168.56.101): Hosting Apache and DVWA

**Out-of-Scope**:
- Other lab VMs (Workstation, Kali-Tools)
- Physical devices or external networks

## Goals

- Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) principles for identification and protection
- Identify vulnerabilities typical in small-business environments (e.g., exposed services, web app flaws)
- Document findings, provide remediation plans, and demonstrate risk prioritization
- Simulate communication of results to stakeholders (management/owners)

## Risk Assessment (Pre-Audit)

**Current Assets**:
- Backend server hosting internal web portal and data storage

**Risk Description**:
Inadequate vulnerability management and missing controls could expose customer/organizational data. Lack of regular scans may lead to undetected issues.

**Risk Score**: 8/10 (High)  
**Reason**: No prior formal audits, potential for web application vulnerabilities, limited visibility into service exposure.

**Control Best Practices** (Pre-Audit Gaps):
- Dedicate resources to regular scanning and asset monitoring
- Assess impact of asset loss on business continuity

This scope and goals document guided the technical audit (see `audit-report.md` for findings).
